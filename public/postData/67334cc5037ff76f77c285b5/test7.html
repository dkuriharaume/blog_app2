<p>I&#39;m pretty confident this time around this all works as expected.<br>Now that I&#39;m certain everything&#39;s great then all that&#39;s left for me to do is to refactor the files and codes.</p>
<h2>But, what if this doesn&#39;t work ?</h2>

<p>Well, that&#39;s extremely unlikely but yeah if this turns out to be unsuccessful, then I&#39;d have to invest more time figuring out the root cause of the problem.</p>
