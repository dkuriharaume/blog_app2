# Line break test

So, basically what I want to do now is
to insert a line break at the end of every visually broken lines
like this.

## How about headings?

I don't think it's a problem to insert two spaces at the end of every headings ?
I don't think it hurts to do that.
But best to be careful and not to append spaces at the end of headings.

<!-- image: some cat -->

## How about bullets?

Likewise I don't think it breaks to add extra two spaces at the end of each bulleted items.
But yeah it'd be nice to ommit that behaviour if I can.

## How'bout tables?

It'll be pretty messy if I accidentally put two spaces at the end of every table cell entries.
Try not to add spaces there.

|This|Is|A|Table|
|-|-|-|-|
|Data|Data|Data|Data|
|Data|Data|Data|Data|
|Data|Data|Data|Data|

## And Images?

I'm not entirely sure what happens if I put spaces at the end of image insertion codes.
Best not to place.
